# Wordle Clone

## Description
This is a simple Wordle clone built using React. The game challenges players to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback through colored indicators:
- **Green**: Letter is in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: Letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.
